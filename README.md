# Enhanced Student Directory a.k.a. E.S.D. Demo
My Student Directory Demo app, coded from StudentDirectory codebase (http://www.androidbegin.com/tutorial/android-ormlite-with-sqlite-database-tutorial/), enhanced with new features including Material Design

## Setup
Clone it, use Android Studio and just import your repo to Start!

## Android Support?
I am attempting to provide support up to 2.3.6 / API 10 since many devices still using that.
But i would suggest that you must gonna build / test / run it at least ICS or Jelly Bean or later device versions

## Material on Gingerbread? (Coming up soon!)
Material UI has several limitations until Kitkat was released. So if you want full functionality of it, use at least Kitkat or later

## Reminder
The app can cause several bugs as today, we still on alpha stage

Feel free to explore! :)
